	h3 What is going on here?
	p This page queries 4 different APIs: Foursquare, Google Books, Fitbit and Wakatime. All requests are asynchronous which makes the page load faster and smoother. Fitbit API uses a OAuth 2.0, and Wakatime doesn't support cross-origin requests (still haven't resolved this one).
	p My next steps here are:
		ul
			li Resolving cross-origin issue with Wakatime API by encapsulating this page in a Node application
			li Adding a map via Google Static Map API to Current location
			li Making Current Book to pull a random book from my Currently Reading shelf
			li Visualize heart rate: introduce a heart icon which will blink according to HR
			li Add "Goal Achieved" check mark to Steps and show it whenever I achieve my stepping goal
			li Introduce better designs, icons and typography to the page
			li Introduce an API, which would allow anyone to query this page and get data in return.
